# INTRODUCTION.

A *Network* consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources(such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications.

The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

## Basic types of network.

1. Local Area Network(LAN)

+ A *LAN* is a network that is used for communicating among computer devices, usually within an office building or home.
+ *LAN'S* enable the sharing of resources such as file or hardware devices that may be needed by multiple users ls limited in size, typically spanning a few hundred meters, and no more than a mile.
+ ls fast, with speeds from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps.
+ Requires little wiring, typically a single cable connecting to each device.
+ Has lower cost compared to MAN's and WAN's.
+ *LAN's* can be either wired or wiredless. Twisted-Pair, Coax or Fiber optic cable can be used in wired LAN's.

2. Personal Area Network(PAN)

+ A *PAN* is a network that is used for communicating among computer devices, usually home.
+ PAN's enable the sharing of resources such as files or hardware devices that may be needed by multiple users ls limited in size, typically spanning a few hundred meters.
+ ls fast, with speeds from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps.
+ Requires little wiring, typically a single cable connecting to each device.
+ Has lower cost compared to MAN's and WAN's.
+ PAN's can be either wired or wiredless. Twisted-Pair, Coax or Fiber optic cable can be used in wired LAN's.

3. Metropolitan Area Network(MAN)

+ A *MAN* is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.
+ A MAN is optimized for a large geographical area than a LAN, ranging from several block of buildings to entire cities.
+ A MAN might be owned and operated by a single organizations, but it usually will be used by many individuals and organizations.
+ A MAN often acts as a high speed network to allow sharing of regional resources.
+ A MAN typically covers an area of between 5 and 50 Km diameter.
+ Example of MAN: Telephone company network that provides a high speed DSL to customers and cable TV network.
