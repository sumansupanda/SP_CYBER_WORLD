# INTRODUCTION.

A *Network* consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources(such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications.

The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

## Basic types of network.

1. Local Area Network(LAN)

A *LAN* is a network that is used for communicating among computer devices, usually within an office building or home.

*LAN'S* enable the sharing of resources such as file or hardware devices that may be needed by multiple users ls limited in size, typically spanning a few hundred meters, and no more than a mile.

ls fast, with speeds from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps.

Requires little wiring, typically a single cable connecting to each device.

Has lower cost compared to MAN's and WAN's.

*LAN's* can be either wired or wiredless. Twisted-Pair, Coax or Fiber optic cable can be used in wired LAN's.

2. Personal Area Network(PAN)

+ A *PAN* is a network that is used for communicating among computer devices, usually home.

+ PAN's enable the sharing of resources such as files or hardware devices that may be needed by multiple users ls limited in size, typically spanning a few hundred meters.
