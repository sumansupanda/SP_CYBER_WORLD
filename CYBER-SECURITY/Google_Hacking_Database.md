# INTRODUCTION.

GHDB stands for the `Google Hacking Database`. It is not a hacking tool but rather a collection of information and search queries known as "Google dorks" that can be used to uncover sensitive or vulnerable information on websites. The Google Hacking Database was created by `Johnny Long`, a security researcher, as a resource for penetration testers and security professionals to understand how certain search queries can expose vulnerabilities and sensitive data.

It's important to note that the Google Hacking Database is meant for educational and legitimate security purposes only. It is not intended for malicious activities or unauthorized access to systems. It's always recommended to obtain proper authorization and adhere to ethical guidelines when conducting any security assessments or penetration testing.
