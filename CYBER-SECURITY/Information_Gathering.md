# INTRODUCTION.

In cybersecurity, an *information-gethering* mission is the act of gathering information on a possible target. This might be done as part of penetration testing, network security monitoring, or other cybersecurity chores.

When obtaining information about possible targets, cybercriminals use many of the same approaches. This is why it is critical to become acquainted with the technologies used in this stage so that you can detect and prevent any unwanted information collecting on your network.

When executing any sort of cybersecurity operation, information collecting is required since it provides the user with additional knowledge about target systems and networks, allowing them to make an informed decision about how to proceed with their attack vector.

If you want to work as a cybersecurity consultant, you must be able to acquire information. The process of gathering information include getting and evaluating information about your target as well as any gaps in their defences.

To finish an information-gathering activity, you must first decide what type of information you want to collect about a target system.
